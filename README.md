# SLTItemGen

**SLTItemGen** is a Streamlit app designed to generate custom item sets aimed at developing instruments for measuring the communicative participation outcomes of school-aged children (6 to 11 years old) with communication difficulties. This tool assists speech-language therapists (SLTs) and parents in assessing and understanding children's participation in social contexts where communication is essential.

## Features

- **Dynamic Item Generation**: Create sets of 10 items tailored to specific communicative participation scenarios.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Utilize dropdown menus to select options and generate items effortlessly.
- **Customizable Focus Areas**: Choose from various aspects of communication, such as verbal skills, non-verbal cues, social interaction, and understanding.

## Purpose

The aim of SLTItemGen is to support the development of assessment instruments that measure how children with communication difficulties engage in life situations involving the exchange of knowledge, information, ideas, and feelings. By providing relevant and targeted items, the app helps SLTs and parents evaluate and enhance the communicative participation of children in social and educational settings.
